# IntelliJ-ish Darcula Theme EDITED

A theme extension for Visual Studio Code based on Darcula theme from Jetbrains
IDE's. This theme is not exactly same with the theme from Jetbrains IDE; I
edited some colors to increase overall contrast as well as few modifications to
match look and feel with VS Code.

## Why!??!

I've Intalled some themes similar to the one I created but I had some minor
issues; lack of contrast with some colors like green and purple, sidebar content
was distracting due to the names of the files and directories were too bright,
integrated terminal was not as I would like it & 20 more things not worth
listing. Overall, this is an effort to create a more pleasant, integrated
experience with VSCode for those, like me, love the darcula theme from the
IntelliJ IDE's.
